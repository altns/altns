## Hello, I'm Abel! 👋

🚀 Full Stack Developer with 25 springs of experience on Earth, primarily wielding JavaScript as my magic wand to create the next big project.

☕ In my day-to-day, I'm a coffee worshipper and somehow find a way to keep my creative flame burning, even if it means dealing with a little heartburn now and then. 😉🔥

💻 I'm a code juggler, balancing between front-end and back-end with the grace of a circus master. I turn lines of code into amazing user experiences and robust functionalities.

🎮 In my moments of relaxation, I enjoy playing video games and trying not to be defeated by AI in strategy games. Challenges are my middle name!

👨‍💻 My goal is to make a positive impact in the world of technology and leave behind a legacy of well-documented code with a sense of humor.

📚 If you want to chat about web development, technology, or just exchange funny stories about bugs, feel free to reach out here.
